# config

This config is built upon the shoulders of bloggers and coworkers (giants?)
There is an emacs config, a profiles.clj, and a few bash convinences.

## emacs

The focus is to provide a configuration for development that includes
auto-completion, structural editing, and highlighting. Mouse-less navigation is a goal so various forms of jumping and searching are included

## requirements

* emacs 25 or greater
* ripgrep
* bash
* leiningen

## installation

````
./install.sh
````

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, the third-party packages
will be automatically downloaded and installed.
